Banana CPU Stress Test, a stupid simple CPU stress tester created with 2 lines of code in qb64.
Runs on macOS, Windows edition comes whenever I bother installing qb64 on Windows.
Open as many instances as you have threads in your CPU.
Works by spamming "banana" on your screen as fast as your CPU can interpert QBASIC.
If your computer starts spitting flames, I was never here.
